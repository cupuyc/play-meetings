Tasks:
1. Create layout UI. We need 3 sections layouted as in http://trembit.com/upload/j3inyx7o.png:
 - chat are as it is on that page https://bistri.com/bistridemo/conf. 
 - video area, with 2 panels. One for me and one for remote user.
 - content area. For now it should be empty
2. Put buttons over own video. Enable/disable video. Enable/disable audio. Change remote user volume slider.
3. Load some image in content area and add controls for: zoom, drag. So it can be like image viewer.
4. Style better chat. Maybe like from like https://togetherjs.com/examples/drawing/
